To reproduce Figures 4 and 5 of the article with a fresh plain-vanilla Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS installation, click on "Code", then "Download ZIP".
Open a Terminal and navigate to the Downloads folder (e.g. `cd ~/Downloads/`).
Unzip the file.
```
unzip effectiveness_of_interactive_cartograms-master.zip
```

Install the dependencies.
```
cd effectiveness_of_interactive_cartograms-master/
sudo sh install_dependencies.sh
```

Enter your Ubuntu password if prompted.

Figures 4 (objective_measures.pdf) and 5 (subjective_measures.pdf) are generated by these commands:

```
sudo Rscript objective_measures.R
sudo Rscript subjective_measures.R
```

- interactive_cartogram_objective_measures.csv
    * `participant_id`: matches participant ID in
      interactive_cartogram_participant_info.csv

      The value is TRUE if and only if animation is available (i.e. if
      `interactive_feature` equals "CSA" or "All") and the participant played
      the animation.
